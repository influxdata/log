# log

Package log implements a simple structured logging API inspired by [apex/log](https://github.com/apex/log), designed with centralization and log levels in mind. Some code from [apex/log](https://github.com/apex/log/blob/master/LICENSE) was used for the initial implementation.

The primary difference between the two is that each logger has its own level and inherits the level from its parent.
